# Ride Sharing System

## User Roles
In this project, three distinct user roles have been established: Traveler, Admin, and the Traveler
companion.
### Traveler:
1. Travellers should have the ability to share ride details (e.g., TripId, Driver Name, Driver Phone
Number, cab number, etc.) through WhatsApp or SMS if the trip is in progress and expire the link
after the Trip is complete.
2. Users can review the audit trail of the rides they have shared.
### Traveler companion:
1. Track the ride of the traveler.
2. Should get a notification when the trip is complete.
3. Should get the nearby notification when the cab hits the geofence of the traveler drop.
4. Share the feedback of the experience with Admin.
### Admin:
1. Admins have access to view all the rides shared by users.
2. The Admin should be able to access the overall experience feedback of the users.
